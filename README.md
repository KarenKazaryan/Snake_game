Welcome to the edges of my project!

This is a snake game.
The basic logic of the game is that the snake eats an apple and grows in size, 1 apple = +1 snake length.
There is also a game score, the ability to resume the game by pressing the R button, or close the game by pressing the Q button

What is needed to run the program:
Library pygame
To install it, use the command pip install pygame in the terminal in the directory Snake

I plan to make a big project out of this:
- So that the user can customize the game to his taste (colors, fonts, window styles);
- He could choose to end the game when the snake goes beyond the window borders, or exit from the opposite side and continue crawling;

Perhaps someday the game will be available on Android
